# JetpackDemo
Android example project of using some of jetpack elements(Databinding, Navigation, LiveData, ViewModel)

This example project is consists of some jetpack elements usages. Very simple and clean code to understand.

1. Databinding: No more use of findViewById() and use variables in the XML file!

2. Navigation: Navigate from one activity/fragment to another one using XML action code!

3. LiveData: Your data will tell you whenever any change happens to it!

4. ViewModel: Free from view and do the logical operations.
